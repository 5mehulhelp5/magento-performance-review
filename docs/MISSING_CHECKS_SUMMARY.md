# Missing Performance Checks Summary

## Critical Performance Checks Not Yet Implemented

### 1. PHP OPCache Configuration âš¡ HIGH IMPACT
Currently missing checks for:
- OPCache memory consumption (should be >= 512MB)
- Max accelerated files (should be >= 130000 for Magento)
- Timestamp validation (should be disabled in production)
- Interned strings buffer optimization

**Impact**: Improper OPCache configuration can cause 50-70% performance degradation

### 2. MySQL/MariaDB InnoDB Settings âš¡ HIGH IMPACT
Currently missing checks for:
- InnoDB buffer pool size (should be 70% of RAM)
- InnoDB log file size (impacts write performance)
- Thread concurrency settings
- Query cache (should be disabled in MySQL 8.0)

**Impact**: Poor MySQL configuration can cause 30-50% slower database operations

### 3. Redis Configuration âš¡ HIGH IMPACT
Currently missing checks for:
- Memory eviction policy
- Separate Redis instances for cache/session/FPC
- Connection timeout settings
- Persistence configuration

**Impact**: Improper Redis configuration can cause cache stampedes and session issues

### 4. PHP Memory and Execution Limits ðŸ”§ MEDIUM IMPACT
Currently missing checks for:
- memory_limit (should be >= 2G for Magento 2.4.8)
- max_execution_time (should be >= 18000)
- realpath_cache_size (should be >= 10M)

**Impact**: Insufficient limits cause timeout errors and memory exhaustion

### 5. Elasticsearch Health ðŸ”§ MEDIUM IMPACT
Currently missing checks for:
- Cluster health status
- JVM heap size
- Index configuration
- Shard allocation

**Impact**: Poor Elasticsearch config causes slow catalog searches

### 6. System Network Tuning ðŸ”§ MEDIUM IMPACT
Currently missing checks for:
- TCP connection limits
- Network buffer sizes
- File descriptor limits

**Impact**: Improper tuning causes connection drops under load

## Quick Wins for Implementation

1. **PHP Configuration Analyzer** - Most impactful, relatively easy to implement
2. **MySQL Configuration Analyzer** - High impact on database-heavy operations
3. **Redis Configuration Analyzer** - Critical for cache performance

## Magento 2.4.8 Specific Considerations

- MySQL 8.0 removes query_cache (must check and recommend disabling)
- PHP 8.1/8.2 compatibility checks needed
- Elasticsearch 7.17 or OpenSearch required (not optional)
- Flat catalog deprecated (should check and recommend disabling)
